A command-line tool for syncing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vaults on headless servers. Uses the official Obsidian Sync protocol over WebSocket with full end-to-end encryption.

Built for running Obsidian vaults on servers where the desktop app isn't available — perfect for automated workflows, CI/CD pipelines, or keeping a server-side copy of your notes.

## Features

- **Bidirectional sync** — pull remote changes and push local edits
- **Real-time watch mode** — continuous sync via WebSocket with filesystem monitoring
- **End-to-end encryption** — AES-256-GCM encryption, scrypt key derivation, compatible with Obsidian's E2E encryption
- **Background service** — install as a systemd user service (Linux) or launchd Launch Agent (macOS) for always-on sync
- **Vault config sync** — syncs `.obsidian/` directory (themes, plugins, settings)
- **Headless operation** — file-based keyring backend, no GUI required
- **Chunked transfers** — handles large files with 2MB chunked uploads/downloads
- **Automatic reconnection** — exponential backoff (1s–60s) on connection loss
- **Hooks** — run custom scripts on sync events (file received, pre/post push, connection loss, etc.)

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install bpauli/tap/obsync
```

### Build from Source

Requires Go 1.25+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bpauli/obsync.git
cd obsync
go build -o obsync ./cmd/obsync
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Log in

```bash
obsync login
```

Enter your Obsidian account email and password. If you have MFA enabled, you'll be prompted for the code. Your auth token is stored in the system keyring.

### 2. List vaults

```bash
obsync list
```

Shows all vaults on your account with their IDs, names, and encryption status.

### 3. Pull a vault

```bash
obsync pull "My Notes" ~/notes -p "your-e2e-password"
```

Downloads all files from the remote vault to a local directory. Use `--save-password` / `-s` to store the E2E password in the keyring for future use.

### 4. Push local changes

```bash
obsync push "My Notes" ~/notes -p "your-e2e-password"
```

Uploads new and modified files, and sends delete notifications for removed files. Only changed files are pushed (compared by SHA-256 hash).

### 5. Watch (continuous sync)

```bash
obsync watch "My Notes" ~/notes -p "your-e2e-password"
```

Starts bidirectional real-time sync. Remote changes are pulled immediately via WebSocket. Local changes are detected via filesystem events (fsnotify) with a 500ms debounce.

## Hooks

Hooks let you run custom scripts in response to sync events — post-process files, trigger builds, send notifications, or commit changes to git.

### Configuration

Hooks are configured in JSON files at two levels:

| Location | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.config/obsync/hooks.json` | All vaults (global) |
| `<vault-path>/.obsync-hooks.json` | Single vault (local) |

Both files are loaded and merged additively.

### Example: bidirectional git sync

Keep your vault backed up in a git repository. This hooks config pulls from git before pushing to Obsidian (to pick up any external changes), and commits + pushes to git after pulling from Obsidian.

Create `~/notes/.obsync-hooks.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PrePush": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "git pull --rebase origin main",
            "timeout": 60
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostPull": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "git add -A && git diff --cached --quiet || (git commit -m \"sync: $(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S)\" && git pull --rebase origin main && git push origin main)",
            "timeout": 60
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **PrePush** — before obsync pushes local changes to the vault, `git pull --rebase` brings in any commits pushed to git externally (e.g. from CI or another machine). If the rebase fails, the hook exits non-zero and obsync continues anyway (non-blocking by default).
- **PostPull** — after obsync pulls remote changes to disk, stages everything, commits if there's a diff, rebases on the remote to avoid merge commits, and pushes to git.

### Hook events

#### File-level events (fire per file)

| Event | When it fires | Matcher |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PostFileReceived` | After a file is pulled and written to disk | regex on file path |
| `PostFilePushed` | After a file is pushed to remote | regex on file path |
| `PostFileDeleted` | After a file is deleted | regex on file path |

#### Operation-level events (fire once per operation)

| Event | When it fires |
| --- | --- |
| `PrePull` | Before a pull begins |
| `PostPull` | After a pull completes |
| `PrePush` | Before a push begins |
| `PostPush` | After a push completes |

#### Watch-mode events

| Event | When it fires |
| --- | --- |
| `WatchStart` | When watch mode begins (after initial sync) |
| `WatchStop` | When watch mode ends (graceful shutdown) |
| `ConnectionLost` | When the WebSocket connection drops |
| `ConnectionRestored` | When reconnection succeeds |
| `SyncError` | When a non-fatal sync error occurs |

### Configuration schema

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostFileReceived": [
      {
        "matcher": ".*\\.md$",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "./scripts/process-note.sh",
            "timeout": 30
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | yes | — | Only `"command"` for now |
| `command` | yes | — | Shell command (run via `sh -c`) |
| `timeout` | no | 30 | Seconds before killing the process |

The `matcher` field is a regex matched against the file path for file-level events. Omit it or set to `""` / `"*"` to match all files. Operation and watch events ignore matchers.

### Exit codes

Hooks control flow via their exit code:

| Exit code | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success — continue |
| `2` | **Block** — abort the current operation (stderr is shown as the error) |
| any other | Non-blocking warning — log and continue |

This means the hook script itself decides whether a failure should stop the sync or just warn. For example, a `PrePush` validation hook can `exit 2` to prevent the push, while a `PostFileReceived` notification hook can `exit 1` on failure without interrupting the pull.

### Stdin and environment

Each hook receives JSON context on stdin:

```json
{
  "event": "PostFileReceived",
  "vault_name": "My Notes",
  "vault_id": "abc123",
  "vault_path": "/home/user/notes",
  "file": {
    "path": "Daily Notes/2024-01-15.md",
    "local_path": "/home/user/notes/Daily Notes/2024-01-15.md",
    "size": 1234,
    "hash": "abcdef..."
  }
}
```

Hooks also receive these environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `OBSYNC_EVENT` | Event name (e.g. `PostFileReceived`) |
| `OBSYNC_VAULT_NAME` | Vault name |
| `OBSYNC_VAULT_ID` | Vault UID |
| `OBSYNC_VAULT_PATH` | Local vault directory path |
| `OBSYNC_FILE_PATH` | (file events only) Relative file path |

## Commands

| Command     | Description                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `login`     | Log in to Obsidian Sync                               |
| `list`      | List available vaults                                 |
| `pull`      | Pull remote vault changes to a local directory        |
| `push`      | Push local changes to a remote vault                  |
| `watch`     | Watch and continuously sync a vault bidirectionally   |
| `install`   | Install a background service for continuous sync      |
| `uninstall` | Uninstall the background service for a vault          |
| `status`    | Show the status of the background service             |

### Global Flags

```
-v, --verbose    Enable verbose/debug logging
-j, --json       Output JSON to stdout
    --config     Path to config file (or OBSYNC_CONFIG env var)
    --version    Print version and exit
```

### pull / push / watch Flags

```
-p, --password        E2E encryption password
-s, --save-password   Save E2E password to keyring for future use
```

## Background Service

Install obsync as a background service for always-on vault sync. The CLI auto-detects the platform and uses the native service manager.

```bash
# Install and start the service
obsync install "My Notes" ~/notes

# Check service status
obsync status "My Notes"

# Stop and remove the service
obsync uninstall "My Notes"
```

### Linux (systemd)

The `install` command creates a systemd user service at `~/.config/systemd/user/obsync@<vault-id>.service`.

```bash
# View logs
journalctl --user -u obsync@<vault-id>.service -f
```

For headless servers (no active login session), enable lingering:

```bash
loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

The generated service file uses the `file` keyring backend automatically. Set `OBSYNC_KEYRING_PASSWORD` before installing if you use a custom keyring password.

### macOS (launchd)

The `install` command creates a Launch Agent at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.obsync.<vault-id>.plist`. The agent starts automatically on login and restarts on failure.

```bash
# View logs
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/obsync/<vault-id>.err.log
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/obsync/<vault-id>.out.log
```

No additional configuration is needed — macOS Keychain works natively for user Launch Agents.

## Security & Keyring

obsync stores credentials in the system keyring:

- **Auth token** — obtained via `obsync login`
- **E2E password** — optionally saved with `--save-password`

### Keyring Backends

| Backend          | Description                        | Platforms      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `auto`           | Auto-detect (default)              | All            |
| `keychain`       | macOS Keychain                     | macOS          |
| `secret-service` | GNOME Keyring / KWallet via D-Bus  | Linux (desktop)|
| `kwallet`        | KWallet directly                   | Linux (KDE)    |
| `file`           | Encrypted file (~/.obsync-keyring) | All (headless) |

Set the backend via environment variable:

```bash
export OBSYNC_KEYRING_BACKEND=file
export OBSYNC_KEYRING_PASSWORD=mysecret  # password for the file backend
```

The `file` backend is recommended for headless servers where no desktop keyring is available.

## Configuration

Config is stored at `~/.config/obsync/config.json`:

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "device": "my-server"
}
```

| Field    | Description                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `email`  | Obsidian account email (set by `obsync login`)   |
| `device` | Device name sent to sync server (defaults to hostname) |

Override the config path with `--config` or `OBSYNC_CONFIG`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable                  | Description                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `OBSYNC_CONFIG`           | Path to config file                      |
| `OBSYNC_KEYRING_BACKEND`  | Keyring backend (`auto`, `file`, etc.)   |
| `OBSYNC_KEYRING_PASSWORD` | Password for the `file` keyring backend  |
